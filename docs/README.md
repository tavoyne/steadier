## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hear ye, hear ye!** If you're an experienced developer, a seasoned library maintainer, an unrivaled strategist or a designer of genius, Steadier needs you. It's an ambitious project that I won't be able to carry out on my own. Its success depends on people like you. It's completely new, so every brick remains to be laid. Reach me if you're willing to join the adventure: [theo@blackjelly.co](mailto:theo@blackjelly.co) ([@tavoyne](https://github.com/tavoyne)).

The advent of [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in the recent years demonstrated that the ecosystem was in need for a configless, opinionated way of checking code. Steadier is an attempt to extend all the good Prettier has brought to _code formatting_ to _code-quality checking_.

## Why Steadier?

> _Web developers of all countries, unite!_

We live in a world in which [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) exists. This means that, even if your target user is a texan farmer and his 2002 PC (don't judge, it's a promising niche), you should be writing code in an _ES2021_ fashion. Why is that great? Because it means that, no matter what kind of web developer you are, we can all share the same style guide, enforce the same conventions, push the web forward in unity. Isn't that beautiful?

Every year, [TC39](https://tc39.es/) is making JavaScript (formally, ECMAScript) a bit better. Unfortunately, most developers (especially newcomers) are not aware of the latest novelties and deprecations. This causes all the code produced by the ecosystem to be highly heterogeneous. And it's getting worse every year when a new ECMA version is out, which is rather paradoxical. What if some tool could guide you in using the most modern syntaxes while avoiding common pitfalls?
